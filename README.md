Welcome! Let me explain how this game works.

Step 1: First you input a letter.

Step 2: If the letter is not the correct letter, the letter you typed will be displayed and you will use up one of your tries. Then you will have another chance to try. You have a limited amount of guesses though so be careful! 

Step 3a: If you guessed the correct letter, then you win! You get a point and you can continue playing with a new game and a new letter to guess.

Step 3b: If you used up all your guesses, you lose! You will get a loss and can continue playing with a new game and a new letter to guess.

And that's it! Enjoy the game!
